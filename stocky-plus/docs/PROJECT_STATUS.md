D-052 remains technical acceptance of the reviewed PR 4 repository implementation. PR #20 is now **MERGED AND CLOSED**. Phase 1 PR 4 is **MERGED — CLOSURE PR PENDING**. Do **not** state that Phase 1 is complete. Do **not** start PR 5. Do **not** create D-053 or another runtime correction cycle.

## Phase 1 PR 4 D-051 (historical correction closure)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Decision | **D-051 — Phase 1 PR 4 per-shop readiness lock scope (close global convoy)** |
| D-051 CORRECTION CLOSURE | **APPROVED**. **Not PR 4 acceptance** (acceptance is D-052). |
| Independently reviewed head | `938e9981dc5f4e551e0cebd37250ae7a40507575` |
| D-051 runtime/test implementation head | `05bcb88c213be8823e840c8233b98d46236ff644` |

| Independent / ChatGPT verdict | `APPROVE D-051 CORRECTION CLOSURE` |
| In-scope findings closed | **F-CLAUDE-D050-01, F-CLAUDE-D050-02, F-CLAUDE-D050-03A/B** |
| Migration | `20260812230000_sync_control_plane_d051_readiness_lock_scope` (additive; D-050 migration not edited) |

D-051 architectural truth is unchanged under D-052: deadlock-freedom **correctness basis** is the audited runtime transaction-shape invariant; `stocky.ready_lock_max_shop` is **defense-in-depth** only.

## Gate disposition (post D-052 merge)

**F-016 / R-022:** CLOSED FOR PHASE 1 REPOSITORY IMPLEMENTATION (PR 3)
**Q-011:** CLOSED FOR PHASE 1 IMPLEMENTATION (PR 3)
**Q-002:** OPEN — Partner Dashboard / environment-separation evidence still required
**Q-003:** CLOSED FOR PR 4 REPOSITORY IMPLEMENTATION (D-052). Does **not** authorize production deployment, Partner Dashboard validation, production API-health validation, or production writes.
**Q-008:** OPEN — legal review still required before production privacy policy
**F-PR4-18:** CLOSED FOR PR 4 REPOSITORY IMPLEMENTATION (D-052)
**R-028 / R-029:** OPEN as operational backfill / enforcement-transition risks
**R-095 / R-096 / R-097 / R-098:** OPEN — accepted nonblocking PR 3 residuals; production-rehearsal / rollout-evidence gates
**R-031 / R-032 / R-033 / R-039:** CLOSED FOR PR 4 REPOSITORY IMPLEMENTATION (D-052)
**R-099 through R-121:** CLOSED FOR PR 4 REPOSITORY IMPLEMENTATION (D-052)
**R-125 / R-126:** CLOSED FOR PR 4 REPOSITORY IMPLEMENTATION (D-052)
**R-122:** ACCEPTED NONBLOCKING RESIDUAL (D-052) — carried forward after PR #20 merge
**R-123:** ACCEPTED NONBLOCKING RESIDUAL (D-052) — carried forward after PR #20 merge. Correctness basis = audited runtime transaction-shape invariant. `stocky.ready_lock_max_shop` = defense-in-depth only. F-CLAUDE-D051-01 accepted P3 characterization. F-CLAUDE-D051-02 / F-CLAUDE-PR4ACC-03 future-maintenance risk. No static writer-shape guard in this closure.
**R-124:** CLOSED — no regression; **not reopened**. F-CLAUDE-D051-03 / F-CLAUDE-PR4ACC-04 is accepted nonblocking out-of-scope F-F03 harness load sensitivity for PR 1/PR 3 tooling maintenance, not PR 4 runtime correction.
**R-127:** CLOSED — no regression (D-052; previously CLOSED on D-051 independent evidence)
**R-128:** CLOSED — no regression (D-052; previously CLOSED on D-051 independent evidence)
**F-CLAUDE-PR4ACC-01:** P3 — **RESOLVED BY PR BODY UPDATE** before squash merge (not a runtime correction)
**F-CLAUDE-PR4ACC-02:** P3 — ACCEPTED NONBLOCKING FUTURE MAINTENANCE (2025-10 inbound adapter; do not remove in this PR)
**F-CLAUDE-PR4ACC-03:** P3 — ACCEPTED NONBLOCKING under R-123
**F-CLAUDE-PR4ACC-04:** P3 — ACCEPTED NONBLOCKING OUT-OF-SCOPE TOOLING DEBT (do not reopen R-124)
**Production inventory writes:** UNAPPROVED
**Inventory-write flags:** DEFAULT OFF
**PR 5:** BLOCKED until this closure PR is accepted and merged
**No production deployment**
**No production backfill**
**No ownership repair**
**No inventory mutation**
**Next action:** Return this documentation-only closure PR to ChatGPT for PR 4 closure acceptance. Do not start PR 5. Do not create D-053.
